Predict whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

# k-nearest neighbors algorithm
In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression:
a) In k-NN classification, the output is a class membership. An object is classified by a plurality vote of its neighbors, with the object being assigned to the class most common among its k nearest neighbors (k is a positive integer, typically small). If k = 1, then the object is simply assigned to the class of that single nearest neighbor.
b) In k-NN regression, the output is the property value for the object. This value is the average of the values of k nearest neighbors.

# prerequisite
1. install jupyter notebook (or you can use any other python platform also)
2. install numpy, pandas & matplotlib.

# Description of repository:
1. Diabetes_XTrain.csv, Diabetes_YTrain.csv & Diabetes_Xtest.csv are given data set.
2. code.ipynb is code in python to implement K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
3. output.csv is the final result.
